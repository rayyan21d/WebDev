# Managing Complex state

This is where I learnt how to manage complex states. By using form inputs, I learnt how each and every attribute is useful. How to use deconstruction of objects. 

All about events, how to pass around events and extract useful data about them.

What are synthetic events and how to use them in react. When to be cautious about using them?
